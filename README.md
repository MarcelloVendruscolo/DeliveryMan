# A* Search Algorithm
First assignment of the Artificial Intelligence course (1DL340) at Uppsala University. The concept of problem solving by search is exercised in this assignment, particularly the A* algorithm.

The A* search algorithm is implemented for a delivery man to pick-up and deliver packages across a city through optimal routes. The algorithm allows the delivery man to find the optimal route between two points given dynamic traffic conditions. However, other matters besides traffic conditions also affects the performance (i.e., total number of moves), such as the pick-up order of the packages. Inspect the help documentation of the DeliveryMan package file for more details.
