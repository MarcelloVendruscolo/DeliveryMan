# DeliveryMan
First assignment of the Artificial Intelligence course (1DL340) at Uppsala University. The concept of problem solving by search is exercised in this assignment, particularly the A* algorithm.

In this assignment, the A* search algorithm is implemented for a delivery man to pick-up and deliver packages across a city through optimal routes. The algorithm allows the delivery man to find the optimal route between two points given current traffic conditions. However, there are other matters besides traffic conditions that also affects the performance achieved, such as the pick-up order of the packages. Inspect the help documentation of the DeliveryMan package file for more details.
